        Notes
        -----
        - A chapter helps grouping recordings and provides a synchronization point between
          system and UTC timestamps.
        - A chapter is automatically created if needed on the first write after opening the
          container if this function has not been called. The name of the automatically created
          chapter is "Chapter<xx>", where <xx> is the index of the new chapter.
        - It is allowed to call this method at any time to signal a time discontinuity or start
          a new group of recordings.
        - The newly created chapter becomes the current chapter and the RECORDER_CHAPTER_XXXX
          parameters are updated accordingly.
        - The chapter name length cannot exceed 255 characters.
        - When a chapter is created, a synchronized pair of system/UTC timestamps is captured
          and stored in the storage as RECORDER_PARAMETER_CHAPTER_TIMESTAMP and
          RECORDER_PARAMETER_CHAPTER_UTC; the system time timestamp is expressed in nanoseconds
          since the computer booted.
        - When reading back from a container, this pair of synchronized timestamps of the
          corresponding chapter is used internally to compute the value of the (non-zero) utc
          field of a RECORDER_BUFFER_INFO record from the value of the (system) timestamp field.

            Buffer metadata to write to the container.
        buffer : ctypes.c_char_Array_, bytearray or bytes
            Buffer data (pixels) to write to the container.
        context : int, optional
            A user provided asynchronous context.
            - If None (or 0), the write is performed synchronously; the function blocks
            until the data is completely written to disk.
            - Otherwise, an asynchronous write is scheduled; the function returns immediately
            while the data is written to disk in the background. The context is further used
            to identify the completed write (cf. AsyncResult.completed).

        Notes
        -----
        - A `ctypes.c_char_Array_` buffer can be obtained using `to_cchar_array` helper function,
          given a pointer and size of the buffer.
        - If both `buffer` and `info` are None (or 0), the function will wait for an asynchronous
          write to complete (and return its handle and status).
          For a more user-friendly interface, `Recorder.wait_for_completed_write` should be used to
          handle completed asynchronous writes.
        - The buffer info and data are written to the container at the current index position
          (RECORDER_PARAMETER_RECORD_INDEX); the recorder index is automatically incremented
          by one after a write and the recorder count (RECORDER_PARAMETER_RECORD_COUNT) is also
          adapted accordingly.
        - The order in which asynchronous writes complete is not specified and should not be assumed.

        Notes
        -----
        - Export starts at the current index position (`RECORDER_PARAMETER_RECORD_INDEX`)
          in the container and goes on until `count` records have been exported or the
          end of the container is reached. The `RECORDER_PARAMETER_RECORD_INDEX` is updated
          accordingly.
        - File name decoration uses the @ character as a place holder for the following:
          - @i for the index relative to the first record in the container
               (number of digits used is defined by the number of records in the container)
          - @n for the index relative to the current record written
               (number of digits used is defined by the `count` parameter)
          - @p for the part index relative to the record
               (number of digits used is defined by the buffer part count of the record)
          - @t for the timestamp of the exported record
          - @c for the chapter index
          - @C for the chapter name
          - @@ for the literal @
          All other @ patterns are invalid and will lead to a `RECORDER_STATUS_INVALID_ARGUMENT` exception.
        - The file format is derived from the file extension:
          - .tiff or .tif for the TIFF file format
          - .mkv for the Matroska MKV file format (using the V_UNCOMPRESSED codec)
        - The allowed values for `export_pixel_format` depend on the file type:
          - TIFF files support the following: Mono8, Mono16, RGB8, RGB16
          - MKV files support the following: Mono8, RGB8
        - For TIFF files:
          - if `count` is greater than 1 and `path` does not contain any @ pattern, we add .@n before
            the file extension
          - if a record contains more than 1 part and the path does not contain the @p pattern,
            we add `.@p` before the file extension
        - For MKV files:
          - the export operation creates one MKV file per chapter; if the export operation
            spans several chapters, we add `@.n` automatically before the file extension
          - the image width, height and pixel format must be constant for the entire file;
            the first exported image is used to define these values. A subsequent image with a
            different format will be simply skipped and the returned count will not be updated.
          - timestamps increase monotonically; when a backward discontinuity is detected i.e. the
            relative time from the beginning of the file of the image to be written is less than the
            relative time of the latest image written, a new time reference is taken.
        - Most of the times, a record contains one image (one buffer part) so the number of exported
          images matches the number of exported records; but, if a record contains more than 1 part,
          each part is exported as a separate image so the number of exported images will
          be greater than the returned `count`.
        - When `record_flags` is `RECORDER_RECORD_FLAG_BUFFER_DATA_VALID`, only valid records are exported.

            Path to the recorder container.
